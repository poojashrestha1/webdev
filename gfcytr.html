<p> Hello this is my <b> my paragraph </b>. <br> <i> Schizophrenia </i> is a chronic and severe mental disorder that affects how a person thinks, feels, and behaves. People with schizophrenia may seem like they have lost touch with reality. Although schizophrenia is <s> common </s> as other mental disorders, the symptoms can be very disabling. </p>
